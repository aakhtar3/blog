I recently went on a certification binge to get 12 certs in 5 months (Nov/4/23 - Apr/20/22). Below are some strategies to stack multiple certifications to stack your resume and LinkedIn profile.

## Scrum

![Scrum Path](./img/scrum_path.png)

### ScrumMaster

> Foundation -> Advanced -> Professional -> Elevated

### Developer

> Foundation -> Advanced -> Professional

### Product Owner

> Foundation -> Advanced -> Professional

My journey started back in 2016 when I first got my `Certified ScrumMaster` certification through [scrumalliance.org]. The certification needs to be renewed before the two-year renewal date. Typically, I would obtain the scrum education units ([SEU]) and pay the renewal fee. However, in late 2020, I wanted to pick up a new `Scrum Developer` certification. I plan on getting `Product Owner` and then moving onto the `Advanced` level where the certs start to stack on renewal.

## AWS

![AWS Path](./img/aws_path.png)

### DevOps

> Cloud Practitioner -> Developer Associate -> DevOps Engineer Professional

> Cloud Practitioner -> SysOps Administrator Associate -> DevOps Engineer Professional

### Solution Architect

> Cloud Practitioner -> Solutions Architect Associate -> Solutions Architect Professional

### Speciality

> Speciality

I skipped the `Cloud Practitioner` and plan on taking the `Speciality` certs at some point. I had already taken the three `Associate` and two `Professional` certifications through [aws.amazon.com] in early 2020, but they needed to be renewed before the three-year renewal date. Luckily, these certifications stack, so I only needed to take two `Professional` exams to receive all five certifications in late 2022.

## CompTIA

![CompTIA Path](./img/comptia_path.png)

[Comptia.org] was new to me but they offer a few tracks to allow stackable certifications. I skipped `A+` and `Server+` but instead went straight for Infrastructure and Cyber Security certifications.

### Infrastructure

> A+ -> Server+

> A+ -> Network+ -> Security + -> Linux+ -> Cloud+

Cloud+ can be renewed by either retaking the test before the three years renewal date or obtaining 50 Continued Education Units ([CEU]). The [cloud renew list] has the AWS certifications that I already obtained. Going forward I will only need to take an AWS exam to recertify the CompTIA infrastructure certifications.

### Cyber Security

> A+ -> Network+ -> Security+ -> CySa+ -> CASP+

> A+ -> Network+ -> Security+ -> PenTest+ -> CASP+

CASP+ can be renewed by either retaking the test before the three years renewal date or obtaining 75 Continued Education Units ([CEU]). I plan on taking college courses, working, and writing blogs to renew this certification. Down the road, I will start taking other non-CompTIA certs on the [CASP renew list].
