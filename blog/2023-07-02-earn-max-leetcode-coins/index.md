|T-shirt|13|8,435 coins|

<!-- truncate -->

Hate it or love it, but [leetcode.com] has become the de facto learning tool to prepare for software engineering coding interviews. Other skills are required to do the job, but this interview standard has its benefits by providing candidates a fair chance at solving a timed problem in a stressful environment.

Investing time to master and retain data structures and algorithms will net you a great ROI by helping you become a top earner. In addition, having a deep understanding of the material will make you a subject matter expert and a top performer.

## Goal

![Leetcode Kit](./img/leetcode_kit.png)

Leetcode has gamified this egregious grind by providing a [store], where you can redeem your earned coins for prizes. The prizes are nothing spectacular, but earning the t-shirt is an exciting challenge since `6,000` (t-shirt) or `7,800` (t-shirt, keychain, and coaster) coins will require a lot of time, discipline, and commitment.
